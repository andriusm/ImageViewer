Image Viewer
============

Overview
--------

This is a very basic image viewer that currently supports only webp images.
It was created as a side-project and is currently in the development phase.
The main objectives are:

- performance
- small size
- portability (should compile on Windows (MinGW) / Linux / Mac OS X)

Compilation
-----------

The easiest way to compile the viewer would be to use the Code:Blocks IDE (http://www.codeblocks.org/).
You'll also need the GLFW library (http://www.glfw.org/) and the source code of WebP library
(http://code.google.com/speed/webp/download.html).

Invocation
----------

    Usage: imgview image.webp

Interaction
-----------

Currently the image can be moved on the screen using the arrow keys. Zooming works by pressing the
add/subtract keys on the keypad, -/= keys or by scrolling the mouse wheel.
