Image Viewer
============

Overview
--------

This is a very basic image viewer that currently supports only webp images.
It was created as a side-project and is currently in the development phase.
The main objectives are:

- performance
- small size
- portability (should compile on Windows (MinGW) / Linux / Mac OS X)

Invocation
----------

    Usage: imgview image.webp

Interaction
-----------

Currently the image can be moved on the screen using the arrow keys. Zooming works by pressing the
add/subtract keys on the keypad, -/= keys or by scrolling the mouse wheel.
